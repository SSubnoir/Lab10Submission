        <p class="proj_content">This was a custom crafting station I modeled, textured, and programmed for a friends game server.
            To create this item in particular, I used the free software tool "Blockbench", demonstrating that regardless of the medium,
            everyone is capable of expressing themselves uniquely.

        <p class="proj_content">When I had more time on my hands before my Senior year of high school and beyond,
            my friends and I would often create game servers with each other similar to popular ones we liked on YouTube.
            To make our own projects seem more authentic, many times we would create trailers or other media to make
            them seem more authentic. This is one of such trailers, edited by yours truly.

    <!-- Div for audio element -->
        <p class="spacer1"></p>
        <p class="proj_content">In all 4 years of my high school education, I had the amazing opportunity to learn music
            production from the spectacular Chris D. Hathcock. Throughout my career in the courses offered by the audio engineer
            and musician, I was able to learn quite a bit about the processes going into digital music composition, producing, 
            mastering, and more. With this knowledge, I created many singles and an album, all of which I hope have
            continued to improve over time.

        <div class="proj_content"><iframe id="hw_page" src="HelloWorld.html"></iframe></div>
        <p class="proj_content">This is the first website, or Html file that I've ever made. While it may not seem like much,
            if you think about all of the individual factors that led up to the creation of it, we can get really existential.
            I had to leave my home country, say bye to all of my friends and family for who knew how long, to go off to China
            and learn how to live my own life. So even though it may not mean much by itself, it's one stone in the rock road
            that's leading forwards into my dreams for the future.
